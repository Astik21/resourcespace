# Announcement
As I don't have time to continue maintaining this container and resolving issues, I will have to announce the EOL of this container with the next version 10.3 of ResourceSpace.

I never expected others to use this container for their deployments of ResourceSpace. For myself, it was just a side project to run my instance in a container instead of bare metal. But I stopped using ResourceSpace quite some time ago and meanwhile switched to using PhotoPrismÂ® for several reasons:

- actual development community fostering collaboration and not just one company maintaining the project on an SVN server
- solid and more modern code base
- transparent roadmap, issues and communication channels
- AI functionality better suited for personal use
- intuitive UI

And since PhotoPrism can offer me the one killer feature I began using ResourceSpace for (stacking different versions of the same photo with JPEG and RAW sharing one entity) I don't see a benefit in ResourceSpace for my personal use case.

If anybody wants to step up and take over the maintenance, please do so. As with every Open Source project you are free to fork and continue using the codebase. I will put the repository on archived after the release of the last 10.3 container.

# resourcespace-docker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/suntorytimed/resourcespace?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/suntorytimed/resourcespace)

A docker image for ResourceSpace based on Ubuntu:latest container including OpenCV, poppler and php8.1.

Please report any issues on GitHub: https://github.com/suntorytimed/resourcespace-docker/issues

## docker-compose example

In this example I use a pre-existing nginx proxy using the [nginx-proxy/acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion) container, which includes a Let's Encrypt/ACME companion to enforce a properly signed https. Please consult the documentation of that container for setup instructions.

```Dockerfile
version: "2"

# frontend network for resourcespace using an already existing nginx proxy for Let's Encrypt
# backend network without public accessibility for the database connection
networks:
  frontend:
    external:
      name: acme-proxy-network
  backend:

# Trying to use bind volumes directly resulted in a 500 error, but using named volumes worked  
volumes:
  mariadb:
  include:
  filestore:

services:
  resourcespace:
    image: suntorytimed/resourcespace:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    # links resourcespace to mariadb container and makes it accessible via the URL mariadb
    depends_on:
      - mariadb-resourcespace
    volumes:
      - include:/var/www/resourcespace/include
      - filestore:/var/www/resourcespace/filestore
    # variables for setting up https via the Let's Encrypt/ACME companion
    environment:
      - HOSTNAME=dam.example.com
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=dam.example.com
      - VIRTUAL_PORT=80
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=dam.example.com
      - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@example.com
    # public and private network
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    # no port bind necessary due to the nginx proxy
    expose:
      - 80
  
  mariadb-resourcespace:
    image: mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    # env file containing the db configuration
    env_file:
      - db.env
    volumes:
      - mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
    # only accesible in private network
    networks:
      - backend
```

When using this example, you need to enter `mariadb-resourcespace` as the URL for the database in the initial ResourceSpace setup. You will also have to provide a db.env file in the same folder as your docker-compose.yml:

```
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secure-password
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=even-more-secure.password
MYSQL_DATABASE=resourcespace
MYSQL_USER=resourcespace
```

With this db.env file you set up your mariadb database for ResourceSpace. You will have to enter the login data in the initial ResourceSpace setup. The MySQL binary path in that setup needs to be empty, as ResourceSpace won't be using a local mysql/mariadb installation.
